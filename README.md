### to do:
+ complete data collection for two episodes

### questions:
+ add RuPaul commentary as control?
+ how specific should the "context" and "episode arc" be? (Must be answered through EDA)
+ measure duration of quote? If so, must capture quote end timestamp

### additional notes:
+ "grouping" refers to conversation. Must improve conversation grouping notation
+ quotation marks for "comment" / actual quote?
+ facial expressions are as good as words -- emojis?
